				<h1>About this project</h2>
			
			<p>Why are we doing this project? This is part of our Design thinking project, we are given with a problem and we have to come up with <br> 
			a unique solution. We interviewed our friends and learned about their problems during this sudden transition between online to offline <br> 
			school . Some of our friends found it difficult to adapt to a new sleep schedule , some of them stated that carrying the bag around is difficult <br>
			and we cannot leave our books at school because of uncertainty . Me and my group mates on this project wanted to find a solution for the sleep
			schedule problem. <br>
			 </p>

			 <h2>Planning process</h2>
				
			 <p> 1.What problem do we work on- We decided to work on the problem of sleep schedule <br>
				<br>
				2. We had to break down the problem into smaller parts and we brainstormed ideas. 
				<br>
				<br>
				3. We had to come up with a solution , we did a lot of research on ways to fall asleep quickly 
				and how to wake up on time. 
				<br>
				<br>
				4. We had to present our solution in an appealing manner , we decided to make  a video with images and us narrating.
				<br>
				<br>
				5. Our solution can benefit anyone trying to adapt to a new sleep schedule , We decided to make <br>
				a website where we inform people about our solution and project.
