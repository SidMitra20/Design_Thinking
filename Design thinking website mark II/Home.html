        <h1> Moving on from online to offline school</h1>
    
		<p>  Moving on from online to offline school isn't easy we as students face many problems that 
			we have to overcome.<br> Many of us have to adapt to new sleep schedules and new routines overall. 
			We have to reach school on time, we have to wear masks most of the day <br>
			and its more tiring. Alongside these challenges there are less significant ones too, For example carrying a heavy bag all day , we cannot leave stuff <br>
			at school (like we normally did before the pandemic) because there is no certainty when the school might shut down.  
			There are ways to overcome<br> these challenges and thats what me and fellow team mates(Amarthya Gupta and Aryan K , For more information read the 'About' page) have been doing. 
			<br>We have chosen the problem of adjusting to our new sleep schedules, and we have come up with a feasible solution for this . Check the 'Solution' page <br>for more information.
